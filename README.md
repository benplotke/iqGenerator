# iqGenerator
Programs for generating practice problems to get better at iq tests.

I started this program to get practice for an iq test I needed to take. It didn't turn out exactly like any of the real iq test problems, but I believe it exercises the pattern recognition necessary to do well on an iq test.

I initially wrote this in Python. More recently I translated the program into Haskell to practice a new language.
